#### Background

Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud provides an easy-to-use; fully autonomous database that scales elastically delivers fast query performance and requires no database administration.

#### Easy
Fully managed cloud service that makes it very simple to provision a data warehouse, quickly and easily load data and query that data using built-in web-based tools such as notebooks.
 
Oracle’s unique autonomous database framework ensures high availability and automatic security–without requiring any additional tasks.
#### Fast
Delivers high performance data warehousing straight out-of-the-box with unparalleled scalability and reliability. Built on key Oracle Database capabilities: parallelism, columnar processing and compression. All aspects of performance tuning are automatically managed so the service requires no database tuning.
#### Elastic
Scale as needed-create and expand your data warehouse’s compute and storage capacity on demand and independently of each other with no downtime. Pay only for the resources you consume.
#### Complete
Integrates directly with the full spectrum of business analytics, data integration and IoT services within Oracle's comprehensive range of integrated cloud solutions.
